#Gender Gap Project

###Project lead researchers

Dr. Ben Malin (Minneapolis Fed) and Dr. Soo Lee (U. Maryland) 

### Ideas

1. In macroeconomic settings, one may hear of the gender gap in labor force participation (or unemployment).      
2. In development economics, there is interest in gender gaps in birth rates,  educational attainment, literacy rates, mortality rates, etc.

### Data Analysis Goal

Quantify gender gaps along various dimensions (variables) across countries and over time.

### Preliminary

create scatter plots to see the relationship (in the cross section of countries) between sex ratio at birth (x variable) and the gender gap (ratio of male to female statistic) for various variables (y variables): 

- literacy rates
- mortality rates
- labor force participation rates
- unemployment
- education attainment rates
